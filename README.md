# NeuralNetworkPlayground
My playgrounds for learning the Julia programming language as well as the internal
processes of artificial neural networks. Currently written in singlethreaded Julia,
I wish to explore and learn to understand the logic and approaches to different
variants of artificial neural networks. Of course, eventually, I wish to expand to
a multithreaded environment as well as utilize OpenCL (since I personally do not
own an NVIDIA GPU).
